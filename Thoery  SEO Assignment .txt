5. Define Favicon and give an illustrative example
Solution: 


Favicon stands for "favorite icon." It is a small, iconic image or symbol that is associated with a website and typically appears in the browser's address bar, next to the site's name in bookmarks or favorites, and in browser tabs. Favicons are used for branding and identification purposes, making it easier for users to recognize and remember a website.

Illustrative Example: Let's say you visit a popular news website like "ExampleNews.com." In your browser's address bar, you might see a tiny image of a newspaper or the website's logo next to the web address (URL). This image is the favicon, and it helps you quickly identify the website among your open tabs or bookmarks. It's a visual representation of the site's brand or content theme in a compact form.
